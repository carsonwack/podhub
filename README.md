# PodHub
### Social media site for Podcast listeners

**Project Description:** Create a Twitter-like site for sharing podcasts/pod episodes.

**General Idea:** Users share posts containing a description/reason for sharing, a podcast thumbnail image, & standard social media actions (comment, like, share), plus a built-in audio player (which possibly supports comments at specific timestamps).

**Target audience:** General public, podcasts listeners.

**Problem:** People like sharing podcasts but other social media sites are awkward/unfit places to do so.

Team Members:** Curtis, Meri, Vahe, Joseph, Lia, Carson

**Solution:** A social media site like twitter but focused specifically on podcasts, where sharing podcasts is seamless -- with features designed to promote discovering, discussing, and listening to podcasts without leaving the site.

**User stories**:

-   US1: As a user, I want to **search** for any podcasts/pod episodes on the site so that I can add it to my favorites, listen to, share with others

-   US2: As a user, I want to **add podcasts/pod episodes to my favorites** so that I can have them in one place

-   US3: As a user, I want to **share** them with other users of the site, so that I can show off the podcasts/pod episodes I listen to

-   US4: As a user, I want to **see** what podcasts/ pod episodes other users listen to, so that I can discover new podcasts/pod episodes from people I follow to

-   US5: As a user, I want to **discuss**/**comment** on post podcast/ pod episode, so that I can share my thoughts and hear what other think about it

-   US6: As a user, I want to **like** posts, so that I can share my impressions

-   US7: As a user, I want to **listen** to the podcast episode not leaving the site, so that I can have one-stop place for sharing and listening podcasts

**GitHub best practices and** **guidance:**

1.  Checkout the master branch using **git checkout master**

2.  3.  Update your local repo with the latest changes using **git pull origin master** **.**

4.  5.  Create and checkout a new branch using **git checkout -b \<your-branch-name\>**

6.  Always include your initials in your branch name followed by the functionality/feature you're working one, example: **vm-userAuthentication**

7.  Run **git add -A**

8.  Run **git commit -m \"descriptive message here\"**

9.  Push these changes back up to GitHub using **git push origin \<your-branch-name\>**

10. Navigate to your repository in GitHub and click the green button to **\"create a pull request\"**

11. Once code is reviewed by at least one reviewer **"merge** **pull request"**

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
